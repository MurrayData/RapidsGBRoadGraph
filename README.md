# RapidsGBRoadGraph
Example cuGraph Python Notebook for RAPIDS AI with Road Graph of Great Britain

We will be using the Ordnance Survey Open Roads dataset which has been converted into a graph.  
A sample is shown below:

![Road_Graph](./img/road_graph.png)

This is a weighted graph, using the edge distance in metres.  
__Note__: The Open Roads dataset starts with vertex ID 1 which the cuGraph analytics assume a zero-based starting ID.
